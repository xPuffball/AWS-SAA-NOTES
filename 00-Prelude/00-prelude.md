## Prelude
>These notes are based on Adrian's Cantrill's AWS SAA-C02 course at learn.cantrill.io - these notes are for personal tracking & development goals - they are not guranteed to be accurate or useful to your study.
### AWS Certifications
AWS Certifications can be broken down into 4 different categories of certs:
- Foundational
- Associate
- Professional
- Specialty

Typically, starting with the Solutions Architect Associate and progressing onto other certifications is the recommended route - a lot of the CCP certification is covered by the SAA cert, so starting with SAA will prevent overlap when progressing with AWS studies.
